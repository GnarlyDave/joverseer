1. Bump the version in
main/resources/ctx/jideApplicationContext.xml
XPath:
 //beans/bean[@id='applicationDescriptor']/property[@name='version']
   @value='1.x.x'

 //beans/bean[@id='applicationDescriptor']/property[@name='buildId']
   @value='2014-x-x'

2. update the version in the changelog.txt

3.build

3. run buildjars.bat

4. ftp latestupdate.zip to megames

5. edit and update feed.xml

(delete the registry entry if testing)

(make sure update/update.jar is present)

start joverseer.

Autoupdate notes
================

version 1.0.12 has new updater technology.


spotting new versions
---------------------
The joverseer application checks the RSS feed for notification of a new release.
"http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/feed.xml"
version 1.0.12 has this hard-wired.
Later versions use the preference
 updates.RSSFeed
 in 
 main/resources/ctx/preferences-context.xml

The official beta RSS Feed is
"http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/betafeed.xml"

Version numbers are compared numerically.
The middle 0 was dropped after 1.0.12, the next version being 1.13.0.
At the same time, it was decided to use odd number versions as beta versions.
That way, the timing of beta and stable releases can be decoupled, and still be consistent numerically.

The checking done in the code:
com.jidesoft.spring.richclient.docking.JideApplicationLifecycleAdvisor class, method onWindowOpened().


update.jar
----------
The key thing about auto updating in general is that at some point you have to spawn and switch to a separate process, so you can change the original files.

The updater is packaged as a separate jar file: update.jar.
It takes one optional argument, the url of the zipfile to download.
Normally it is the contents of the first url found in the RSS feed.
It defaults to ???


The source files

com.middleearthgames.updater.UpdateChecker  - checks the rss feed and compares the version
com.middleearthgames.updater.IThreepartVersion - interface for comparing 2 versions.
com.middleearthgames.updater.Main_Gui - The crude UI for the standalone updater part.
com.middleearthgames.updater.UpdateInfo - lists the changelog contents, and a lot of the complications needed to get updates to work under windows.

so UpdateInfo.update()
spawns java -jar update/update.jar 'download url'
if on linux/unix/mac
and for windows runs
jOverseerUpdate.exe


jOverseerUpdater.exe is a packaged version of java -jar update ....
for windows and tagged to request admin privileges.

update.Main_Gui.java is a simple java AWT application.
moves it to the appropriate place
deletes the initial version of the unpacked files.
and executes any updateapp.jar to execute any version-specific updates beyond just files updates.
NB. the cancel button just exits...it doesn't stop the download or undo the overwrite of files.
