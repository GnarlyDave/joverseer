VERSION 1.14.0
--------------
	* Platform support
		o Recent versions of java (version 7 update 9 and later) have changed some of the look and feel support, which broke jOverseer. This most obviously affected Macs, but also others.
		o The error log file is now written to a temporary directory.
		  + typically on Windows: /users/xxx/AppData/Local/Temp/joverseer_xxxxxxxx.log instead of the program files directory 
		o The window layout is now stored in a file in the user directory.
		  + under windows: /users/xxx/AppData/Roaming/jOverseer/page_mainPage_layout_nullPerspective.layout  instead of the program files directory.
		  + On the mac: ~/Library/Application Support/jOverseer/...
		  + linux: ~/.jOverseer/...
		o The format of the layout file hasn't changed, so you can reuse an old one if you seem to lose your layout after the update. Note that on windows, AppData is a hidden directory.
		o A new installer for Windows, and the two fixes above, means that write access to the install directory is not needed when *running* jOverseer. Hence the install to Program Files directory should now work OK.
		 
	* Current Hex View
		o Bug Fix: An empty list of characters being shown using the new default mergesort in java 7+. 

	* Order List View
		o 'Characters without all orders' filter to show missing orders.
				
	* Internationalization
		o Widespread changes to improve support for different countries and languages (locales).
		o The messages.properties file now should have all the translatable text.
		o The only versions available are messages_es.properties for Spanish readers and messages_it.properties for Italian readers.
		o Orderchecker is not included, and the orders themselves are still in English.
		o For the curious and if you want to force the selection of a locale, there is a command line option. For example '-L es' will select spanish.
		o Preliminary italian support added.
		o Better spanish coverage.
		
	* Orderchecker
		o Fixed so that characters only seen on PDF reports don't stop orderchecker running.
		o Fixed so that it uses the current turn terrain, traffic map and allegiances instead of it's predefined ones.
		o Fixed so that you can issue a challenge when travelling with an army.
		o Fixed so that it spots a buy food order before a move, so army is 'fed'
		o OrderChecker is now packaged as a single java .jar file. If you tweaked the data files that it used then you will need to update the orderchecker.jar file.

	* Edit Nation Allegiance
		o Fixed a bug which resulted in a change in allegiance being partially propagated to future turns. This caused Orderchecker to get confused about changed allegiances especially for Tirkhor and Khazad in Kinstrife games.

      <description>
VERSION 1.0.11
--------------

	* Updater
		o The Updater now spots windows and tries to run with elevated privileges if needed.
		o Added jOverseer.exe to launch jOverseer with the right java options and remove the dos window.
		o Running jOverseerUpdater.exe will always download the latest version.
		
	* Econo Calc
		o The economic calculator now correctly reports that "Your taxes will go up *by* n% to m%"
		
	* Current Hex View
		o Show Army movement is now a toggle. Click it again to remove the displayed range.
		o Show Character Movement Range is now a toggle.
		o The icon/button to display orders no longer jumps left/right when used.

	* Other
		o The Blue Wizard now appears in the Kinstrife characters.

      <pubDate>8 Jan 2014</pubDate>
      <description>
VERSION 1.0.10
--------------

    * Bug Fixes
    	o Symptom: no PC icon, Hex highlight unreliable, no order entry for hex.
    		+ There was a bug causing data corruption of Pop Centre.
    		+ Especially after a PC has been reduced to ruins.
    		+ There may be more than one cause. 
    		+ Please email a copy of the .jov file and a note of which hex shows the problem to middlearth.com.
    	o The Export Order Form no longer lets you mess around with the preformatted order.
    	o The movement calculator was getting confused when moving evasively.
