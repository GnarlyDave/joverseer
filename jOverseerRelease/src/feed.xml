				VERSION 1.16.16
				---------------

				matching artifacts
				with accents.

				problems for fresh installs and pdf parsing.

				unexpected problems.
				Now you're more likely to see an Error Dialog pop up, which also logs
				the problem to the file
				mentioned at the bottom of the Help->Gather Support Data screen.
