VERSION 0.9.1
-------------

25/3/2007

	* Fixed a problem with nation names that contained accents ( e.g. Eothraim, Dunadain Rangers, etc) which was causing problems in parsing pdf data. Saved games are unfortunately not fixed, this change has an effect only on new games.
	
	* Fixed another minor bug with New Game and Nation names.
	
	* Added a new map option to control the way hexes are rendered (in response to remarks about colors seeming "subdued") 
	  Now you can choose textured (the current graphics) or simple, which uses a single color to draw the hexes.
	
	* Ability to scroll the map using the keyboard (in response to Mark's request). You have to click on the map first so that it gets focus. Will see if I can add mouse dragging as well soon.
	
	* Improved the form that shows the progress when importing turns. When the process is finished, a message is shown explaining the kinds of errors that occurred (if any).

	* Fixed a problem with the map size for the larger zoom levels (you were not able to see the whole map) as reported by Mark.
