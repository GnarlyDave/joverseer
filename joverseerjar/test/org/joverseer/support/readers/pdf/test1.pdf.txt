Emergency Contact Number
From time to time, MEPBM has need to contact players regarding 
game actions, turnsheet reception problems, etc... 
For MEPBM to be able to reach players in such instances, day or evening, 
we need an emergency contact phone number, e-mail address, 
fax number, etc... We will not call unless necessary, but having 
such information could help us all avoid missed turns or orders.
