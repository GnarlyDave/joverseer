Encounter Messages
Encounter for Eldacar at 3414.
Making his way along a narrow pass, the poor weather lending need for caution, Eldacar noticed a thin rope, silver in the dim
light, tied to a rock, and dropping down into what looked to be a ravine. Low cloud and heavy mist made seeing more than a
few feet down, but, testing the knot, he reckoned it should hold his weight, should he  wish to risk a descent.
FLEE, leaving the rope and dangerous situation behind.
CLIMB down the rope.
UNTIE the rope.
CUT the rope.
How will Eldacar react ? (Choose any reaction shown in all CAPS or provide info requested in parenthesis. If no reaction is
given, he will be assumed to have chosen "FLEE". )
Encounter for Magor at 1422.
Magor entered a long dusty passage which seemed to go deeper into the earth.
The farther he traveled, the more he got the feeling that something was watching him.
Finally, Spirit forms began to take shape around him. Wights, too, began to appear and to move menacingly toward him.
The battle was short but fierce. He fought with SUCH grim determination that their etheral bodies fled in confusion!
In a dark corner of an even darker alcove a magical Harp named "Tinculin" lay quietly glowing. Magor took it with him.

Report from Harith … My commanders moved among the troops before battle, readying them, bolstering their resolve, and
issuing last minute orders. These troops didn't need much encouragement and waved and joked with their Commanders,
offering bets on who would find the best plunder. Finally the order was given in loud commands. "Charge!! Charge!!"Harith
reports that against the forces of Ciryang, they met our charge with their standard formation. Harith reports that against the
forces of Heldiriel, they met our charge with their standard formation.
After the battle had joined in earnest, heroes made their presence known all over the battlefield.
Emard fought side by side with the troops and diverted many a blade during the pitched battle with his glowing Long Sword.
Heldiriel rode among the troops with his glowing Sword, exhorting them to do their best and daring the enemy to meet him.
Report from Harith ….. Our cavalry were severely hampered by the mountainous terrain and the steep cliffs. While our foot
soldiers were forced to fight the terrain as well as the enemy in these boulder filled ravines and high trails. The troops fought
very well, but more training would have raised them to great heights. They fought with great spirit. Although the enemy fought
hard, we finally succeeded in overwhelming them after a long battle.
Commanders on the scene ordered their troops to salvage what they could from the remains of the enemy forces..
Captain Emard:
2014 Food
Veteran Harith:
679 Food
After the battle. …Ciryang's forces were destroyed/routed in the battle. Ciryang appeared to have survived but suffers from

Tower, and it is under siege or attack.
