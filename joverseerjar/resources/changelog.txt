VERSION 1.14.1
--------------
	Update package fixed.

VERSION 1.14.0
--------------
	* Platform support
		o Recent versions of java (version 7 update 9 and later) have changed some of the look and feel support, which broke jOverseer. This most obviously affected Macs, but also others.
		o The error log file is now written to a temporary directory.
		  + typically on Windows: /users/xxx/AppData/Local/Temp/joverseer_xxxxxxxx.log instead of the program files directory
		o The window layout is now stored in a file in the user directory.
		  + under windows: /users/xxx/AppData/Roaming/jOverseer/page_mainPage_layout_nullPerspective.layout  instead of the program files directory.
		  + On the mac: ~/Library/Application Support/jOverseer/...
		  + linux: ~/.jOverseer/...
		o The format of the layout file hasn't changed, so you can reuse an old one if you seem to lose your layout after the update. Note that on windows, AppData is a hidden directory.
		o A new installer for Windows, and the two fixes above, means that write access to the install directory is not needed when *running* jOverseer. Hence the install to Program Files directory should now work OK.

	* Current Hex View
		o Bug Fix: An empty list of characters being shown using the new default mergesort in java 7+.

	* Order List View
		o 'Characters without all orders' filter to show missing orders.

	* Internationalization
		o Widespread changes to improve support for different countries and languages (locales).
		o The messages.properties file now should have all the translatable text.
		o The only versions available are messages_es.properties for Spanish readers and messages_it.properties for Italian readers.
		o Orderchecker is not included, and the orders themselves are still in English.
		o For the curious and if you want to force the selection of a locale, there is a command line option. For example '-L es' will select spanish.
		o Preliminary italian support added.
		o Better spanish coverage.

	* Orderchecker
		o Fixed so that characters only seen on PDF reports don't stop orderchecker running.
		o Fixed so that it uses the current turn terrain, traffic map and allegiances instead of it's predefined ones.
		o Fixed so that you can issue a challenge when travelling with an army.
		o Fixed so that it spots a buy food order before a move, so army is 'fed'
		o OrderChecker is now packaged as a single java .jar file. If you tweaked the data files that it used then you will need to update the orderchecker.jar file.

	* Edit Nation Allegiance
		o Fixed a bug which resulted in a change in allegiance being partially propagated to future turns. This caused Orderchecker to get confused about changed allegiances especially for Tirkhor and Khazad in Kinstrife games.

VERSION 1.0.12
--------------

    * Bug Fixes
    	o Symptom: no PC icon, Hex highlight unreliable, no order entry for hex.
    		+ There was a bug causing data corruption of Pop Centre.
    		+ Especially after a PC has been reduced to ruins.
    		+ There may be more than one cause.
    		+ Please email a copy of the .jov file and a note of which hex shows the problem to middlearth.com.
    	o The Export Order Form no longer lets you mess around with the preformatted order.
    	o The movement calculator was getting confused when moving evasively.

VERSION 1.0.9

VERSION 0.9.1
-------------

25/3/2007

	* Fixed a problem with nation names that contained accents ( e.g. Eothraim, Dunadain Rangers, etc) which was causing problems in parsing pdf data. Saved games are unfortunately not fixed, this change has an effect only on new games.
	* Fixed another minor bug with New Game and Nation names.
	* Added a new map option to control the way hexes are rendered (in response to remarks about colors seeming "subdued")
	  Now you can choose textured (the current graphics) or simple, which uses a single color to draw the hexes.
	* Ability to scroll the map using the keyboard (in response to Mark's request). You have to click on the map first so that it gets focus. Will see if I can add mouse dragging as well soon.
	* Improved the form that shows the progress when importing turns. When the process is finished, a message is shown explaining the kinds of errors that occurred (if any).
	* Fixed a problem with the map size for the larger zoom levels (you were not able to see the whole map) as reported by Mark.
