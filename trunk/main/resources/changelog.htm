    * Owned artifacts tab - added nation. 

    * Added default sort order on various information tabs so that information is ordered better. Added button to the right (two arrows) so that the user can revert to the default sort if they have changed it.

VERSION 0.9.1
-------------

25/3/2007

	* Fixed a problem with nation names that contained accents ( e.g. Eothraim, Dunadain Rangers, etc) which was causing problems in parsing pdf data. Saved games are unfortunately not fixed, this change has an effect only on new games.
	
	* Fixed another minor bug with New Game and Nation names.
	
	* Added a new map option to control the way hexes are rendered (in response to remarks about colors seeming "subdued") 
	  Now you can choose textured (the current graphics) or simple, which uses a single color to draw the hexes.
	
	* Ability to scroll the map using the keyboard (in response to Mark's request). You have to click on the map first so that it gets focus. Will see if I can add mouse dragging as well soon.
	
	* Improved the form that shows the progress when importing turns. When the process is finished, a message is shown explaining the kinds of errors that occurred (if any).

	* Fixed a problem with the map size for the larger zoom levels (you were not able to see the whole map) as reported by Mark.
